          Hi, I'm a passionate Full Stack Developer with 4 years of experience
          building dynamic, scalable, and efficient web and mobile applications. My
          expertise spans both frontend and backend development, ensuring seamless
          integration and exceptional user experiences.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          I specialize in modern technologies like React Native, React, and NestJS,
          creating intuitive interfaces and robust server-side systems.
          Additionally, I've worked extensively with PHP for microservices,
          enabling efficient communication and interoperability across systems.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Beyond technical skills, I'm committed to writing clean, maintainable
          code and delivering high-quality solutions that align with user needs and
          business objectives. Whether tackling complex problems or implementing
          innovative features, I bring a collaborative and solution-focused mindset
          to every project.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          When I'm not coding, I enjoy unwinding by playing video games, with a
          <span style={{
            cursor: `url(${dotaCursor}), pointer`,
          }}> particular passion for Dota 2</span>. Gaming not only provides relaxation but
          also sharpens my strategic thinking and teamwork skills, which I bring
          into my professional work.
        </p>
